    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab focuses on:\n",
    "- Integrating a provided generalized search engine as a tool inside an agentic workflow\n",
    "- Designing an agentic heuristic system that collaborates to estimate $h(n)$ for NYT Spelling Bee states\n",
    "- Implementing a custom cost function $g(n)$ and evaluating search strategies (Uniform Cost, A*)\n",
    "- Coordinating agent communication via MCP-style tool exposure and A2A interactions\n",
    "- Reflecting on how agentic heuristics complement classical search methods\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: The Spelling Bee problem definition and generalized search function are provided for you. Your primary work is to wire them into your agentic solution and iterate on the heuristic design (see part 2 of this notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integrate a provided generalized search function as a tool within an AutoGen-based agentic system\n",
    "- Design and implement an agent team that produces numeric heuristic estimates to guide search\n",
    "- Define and justify a cost function that complements your heuristic in the Spelling Bee domain\n",
    "- Specify MCP-style tool schemas and A2A message flows for heuristic collaboration\n",
    "- Analyze how different heuristic strategies impact search quality, cost, and convergence"

    "### Agent 1: FeasibilityAnalyst\n",
    "- **Role:** Constraint checker and dictionary validator\n",
    "- **Responsibilities:** \n",
    "  - Check if state contains only allowed letters\n",
    "  - Verify required letter is present\n",
    "  - Assess if current prefix exists in valid word prefixes\n",
    "- **Inputs:** Current state (partial word), allowed letters, required letter\n",
    "- **Outputs:** Score 0-10 reflecting constraint satisfaction, rationale\n",
    "- **Success Criteria:** Correctly identifies invalid prefixes that can't lead to solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent 2: CompletenessEstimator  \n",
    "- **Role:** Distance-to-goal estimator\n",
    "- **Responsibilities:**\n",
    "  - Estimate how many more letters needed to form valid word\n",
    "  - Consider minimum word length (4 letters)\n",
    "  - Assess likelihood of common word patterns\n",
    "- **Inputs:** Current state length, min word length, letter usage patterns\n",
    "- **Outputs:** Score 0-10 (higher = closer to completion), rationale\n",
    "- **Success Criteria:** Provides lower scores for short states, higher for near-complete words\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent 3: HeuristicAggregator\n",
    "- **Role:** Score coordinator and combiner\n",
    "- **Responsibilities:**\n",
    "  - Collect scores from FeasibilityAnalyst and CompletenessEstimator\n",
    "  - Weight and combine scores into single h(n)\n",
    "  - Ensure admissibility (never overestimate distance to goal)\n",
    "- **Inputs:** Sub-agent scores and rationales\n",
    "- **Outputs:** Single numeric FINAL_SCORE\n",

    "\n",
    "**Chosen Pattern:** Manager-Worker with Sequential Coordination\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification:**\n",
    "- Manager (HeuristicAggregator) coordinates two specialist workers\n",
    "- Sequential because feasibility must be checked before estimating completeness\n",
    "- Simpler than full collaborative team, reduces message overhead\n",
    "- Clear responsibility boundaries minimize conflicts\n",

    "- Agents discuss state in sequence, aggregator produces FINAL_SCORE\n",
    "- cost_fn returns len(next_state) (each letter added costs 1)\n",

    "## Reflection & Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heuristic effectiveness\n",
    "The agentic heuristic system effectively guided the search by correctly identifying valid 4-letter dictionary words (DOLL, DOOR, DROP, LOAD, LOOP, etc.) with a score of 0.0, signaling they were already complete and required no additional letters. The system maintained admissibility by assigning 1.0 to all 3-letter prefixes, ensuring it never overestimated the remaining distance since at least one more letter was always needed to reach the 4-letter minimum. The collaboration between FeasibilityAnalyst and CompletenessEstimator provided solid reasoning for each state, and A* completed in 42 expansions versus 43 for uniform cost search for the provided example, showing the heuristic provided measurable guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Failure modes / surprises\n",
    "The heuristic's major weakness was its lack of differentiation between 3-letter prefixes - all received a final score of 1.0 despite sub-agents identifying significant quality differences. For instance, \"PRO\" was rated 8.0 for its many productive continuations while \"ERR\" scored around 6.5-7.0, yet both collapsed to the same final heuristic of 1.0. This over-conservative aggregation meant the search couldn't prioritize more promising paths, essentially reducing A* to behave nearly like uniform cost search. The aggregator's strict interpretation of admissibility sacrificed valuable discriminatory power that the specialist agents had identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost vs. heuristic alignment\n",
    "The cost function (character count with 1.2x penalty for words >7 letters) and heuristic (remaining letters needed) shared compatible units based on letter count, creating reasonable alignment where f(n) = g(n) + h(n) represented total estimated path length. However, the 1.2x multiplier for longer words introduced a slight scale mismatch - the cost increased faster than linearly while the heuristic decreased linearly. This alignment was sufficient for the search to function properly, but the penalty factor meant that g(n) and h(n) weren't measuring exactly the same \"distance\" metric, potentially affecting the optimality of paths with longer words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Communication insights\n",
    "The RoundRobinGroupChat pattern with TextMentionTermination provided clear sequential coordination, allowing specialist agents to contribute focused analyses before the aggregator synthesized them into a final score. The structured message flow (Aggregator → FeasibilityAnalyst → CompletenessEstimator → Aggregator) worked well for ensuring all perspectives were captured. However, the overhead of multiple LLM calls per state evaluation (3 agents × ~40 states = 120+ API calls) significantly increased latency compared to a traditional heuristic function. The text-based score parsing (extracting \"SCORE: X.X\" and \"FINAL_SCORE: X.X\") was brittle and occasionally required error handling when formatting varied.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future improvements\n",
    "The aggregator could preserve more nuance from sub-agent scores rather than collapsing all non-goal 3-letter states to 1.0 - for example, using weighted combinations like (10 - average_score)/10 to maintain some differentiation while staying admissible. Adding a dictionary-aware agent that actually checks if prefixes exist in valid word lists would prevent exploring impossible branches early. Implementing memoization/caching would avoid re-evaluating identical states, dramatically reducing the 120+ LLM calls needed. Finally, experimenting with dynamic agent teams that activate different specialists based on state length or characteristics (e.g., a PangramDetector for longer words) could provide more targeted heuristic estimates for different regions of the search space.Retry"
