    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab focuses on:\n",
    "- Integrating a provided generalized search engine as a tool inside an agentic workflow\n",
    "- Designing an agentic heuristic system that collaborates to estimate $h(n)$ for NYT Spelling Bee states\n",
    "- Implementing a custom cost function $g(n)$ and evaluating search strategies (Uniform Cost, A*)\n",
    "- Coordinating agent communication via MCP-style tool exposure and A2A interactions\n",
    "- Reflecting on how agentic heuristics complement classical search methods\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: The Spelling Bee problem definition and generalized search function are provided for you. Your primary work is to wire them into your agentic solution and iterate on the heuristic design (see part 2 of this notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integrate a provided generalized search function as a tool within an AutoGen-based agentic system\n",
    "- Design and implement an agent team that produces numeric heuristic estimates to guide search\n",
    "- Define and justify a cost function that complements your heuristic in the Spelling Bee domain\n",
    "- Specify MCP-style tool schemas and A2A message flows for heuristic collaboration\n",
    "- Analyze how different heuristic strategies impact search quality, cost, and convergence"

    "### Agent 1: FeasibilityAnalyst\n",
    "- **Role:** Constraint checker and dictionary validator\n",
    "- **Responsibilities:** \n",
    "  - Check if state contains only allowed letters\n",
    "  - Verify required letter is present\n",
    "  - Assess if current prefix exists in valid word prefixes\n",
    "- **Inputs:** Current state (partial word), allowed letters, required letter\n",
    "- **Outputs:** Score 0-10 reflecting constraint satisfaction, rationale\n",
    "- **Success Criteria:** Correctly identifies invalid prefixes that can't lead to solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent 2: CompletenessEstimator  \n",
    "- **Role:** Distance-to-goal estimator\n",
    "- **Responsibilities:**\n",
    "  - Estimate how many more letters needed to form valid word\n",
    "  - Consider minimum word length (4 letters)\n",
    "  - Assess likelihood of common word patterns\n",
    "- **Inputs:** Current state length, min word length, letter usage patterns\n",
    "- **Outputs:** Score 0-10 (higher = closer to completion), rationale\n",
    "- **Success Criteria:** Provides lower scores for short states, higher for near-complete words\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent 3: HeuristicAggregator\n",
    "- **Role:** Score coordinator and combiner\n",
    "- **Responsibilities:**\n",
    "  - Collect scores from FeasibilityAnalyst and CompletenessEstimator\n",
    "  - Weight and combine scores into single h(n)\n",
    "  - Ensure admissibility (never overestimate distance to goal)\n",
    "- **Inputs:** Sub-agent scores and rationales\n",
    "- **Outputs:** Single numeric FINAL_SCORE\n",

    "\n",
    "**Chosen Pattern:** Manager-Worker with Sequential Coordination\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification:**\n",
    "- Manager (HeuristicAggregator) coordinates two specialist workers\n",
    "- Sequential because feasibility must be checked before estimating completeness\n",
    "- Simpler than full collaborative team, reduces message overhead\n",
    "- Clear responsibility boundaries minimize conflicts\n",

    "- Agents discuss state in sequence, aggregator produces FINAL_SCORE\n",
    "- cost_fn returns len(next_state) (each letter added costs 1)\n",
