    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab focuses on:\n",
    "- Breaking down complex problems into smaller tasks (task decomposition)\n",
    "- Defining specialized agents with clear roles and responsibilities  \n",
    "- Choosing appropriate multi-agent design patterns\n",
    "- Specifying communication protocols between agents\n",
    "- Implementing a three-agent system using AutoGen\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: If you already know what you're going to do for your final project, you may use this lab to make progress on it. Otherwise, treat this lab as a distinct exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decompose a complex problem into a comprehensive set of constituent tasks\n",
    "- Identify and define the roles, responsibilities, and abilities of individual agents\n",
    "- Select and justify an appropriate multi-agent design pattern (Manager‑Worker, Sequential Pipeline, Collaborative Team)\n",
    "- Explain and apply foundational agent communication protocols at a high level (MCP, A2A)\n",
    "- Start thinking about the architecture of your project (agents, tasks, design pattern, and interaction protocols)"

      "   - Issue: Option B omits suggested start times/durations for the morning activities (breakfast, viewpoint, shopping) and the recommended time to leave for the airport relative to flight time.\n",
      "   - Suggestion: Add example timings (e.g., breakfast 08:00–09:00, quick viewpoint 09:15–09:45, shop 10:00–11:00, depart hotel by 11:00 for a 14:00 international flight allowing 3 hours at LIS).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Transit-card recommendation (practical convenience)\n",
      "   - Issue: The itinerary references single onboard tickets and Viva Viagem in one place, but doesn't explicitly recommend getting a Viva Viagem/contactless card for multiple days.\n",
      "   - Suggestion: Recommend buying/loading a Viva Viagem or rechargeable public-transport card on arrival for easier tram/metro/bus use and to speed transfers (especially useful for Tram 28, tram 15 to Belém, and trains).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Local cost/price context\n",
      "   - Issue: Few price estimates (only a taxi fare range was included). Users often appreciate rough cost ranges for major items (palace tickets, typical Fado dinner price per person, train/bus fares).\n",

      "4. Accessibility and mobility notes\n",
      "   - Issue: Several sites (Pena Palace grounds, São Jorge Castle, Alfama streets) involve hills and many cobblestones; the plan mentions comfortable shoes but could be clearer for travelers with limited mobility.\n",
      "   - Suggestion: Call out which activities are steep/hilly and recommend alternatives or transport options (taxis/local tourist buses) for visitors who need to avoid stairs/steep walks.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Confirmation of opening hours / seasonal caveats\n",
      "   - Issue: The plan advises to check MAAT and museum hours, but could remind the user that some casas de fado have fixed-performance schedules or cover charges separate from meal price.\n",
      "   - Suggestion: Add a note to confirm house rules/cover charges for casas de fado and verify museum/monument seasonal opening hours before booking.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Minor clarity edits\n",
      "   - Example: For Day 1 Tram 28 — emphasize long queues and high pickpocket risk more prominently (you note both elsewhere, but it helps to add next to the Tram 28 item itself).\n",

Acceptance criteria met.\\n- Step 2: Airport → city transfer times and in-city/day-trip transit modes and durations are realistic and within the ranges specified (taxi/metro/train/bus included). Acceptance criteria met.\\n- Step 3: A 5-day itinerary is provided. Each day includes at least two activities, suggested start times, durations, transit modes/time estimates, and reservation notes where appropriate. Cultural, historical, and leisure activities are well balanced. Night 4 explicitly includes a special dining experience (Fado dinner) with reservation guidance and timing. Acceptance criteria met.\\n- Step 4: Reservation checklist flags time-sensitive items (Pena Palace, Fado dinner, etc.) and distinguishes items that can be bought same-day. Acceptance criteria met.\\n- Step 5: Packing, local tips, and contingencies are present (including at least one contingency per major outdoor plan). Acceptance criteria met.\\n\\nGaps, minor errors, or places to improve (specific, actionable)\\n\\n1. Day 5 Option B (relaxed Lisbon morning) — timing specifics\\n   - Issue: Option B omits suggested start times/durations for the morning activities (breakfast, viewpoint, shopping) and the recommended time to leave for the airport relative to flight time.\\n   - Suggestion: Add example timings (e.g., breakfast 08:00–09:00, quick viewpoint 09:15–09:45, shop 10:00–11:00, depart hotel by 11:00 for a 14:00 international flight allowing 3 hours at LIS).\\n\\n2. Transit-card recommendation (practical convenience)\\n   - Issue: The itinerary references single onboard tickets and Viva Viagem in one place, but doesn't explicitly recommend getting a Viva Viagem/contactless card for multiple days.\\n   - Suggestion: Recommend buying/loading a Viva Viagem or rechargeable public-transport card on arrival for easier tram/metro/bus use and to speed transfers (especially useful for Tram 28, tram 15 to Belém, and trains).\\n\\n3. Local cost/price context\\n   - Issue: Few price estimates (only a taxi fare range was included). Users often appreciate rough cost ranges for major items (palace tickets, typical Fado dinner price per person, train/bus fares).\\n   - Suggestion: Add approximate costs (example: Pena Palace €14–€20, Belém Tower/Monastery €6–€10, commuter train Lisbon→Sintra €2.25 one-way, Cascais train €2–€3, Fado dinner €35–€70+ depending on place).\\n\\n4. Accessibility and mobility notes\\n   - Issue: Several sites (Pena Palace grounds, São Jorge Castle, Alfama streets) involve hills and many cobblestones; the plan mentions comfortable shoes but could be clearer for travelers with limited mobility.\\n   - Suggestion: Call out which activities are steep/hilly and recommend alternatives or transport options (taxis/local tourist buses) for visitors who need to avoid stairs/steep walks.\\n\\n5. Confirmation of opening hours / seasonal caveats\\n   - Issue: The plan advises to check MAAT and museum hours, but could remind the user that some casas de fado have fixed-performance schedules or cover charges separate from meal price.\\n   - Suggestion: Add a note to confirm house rules/cover charges for casas de fado and verify museum/monument seasonal opening hours before booking.\\n\\n6. Minor clarity edits\\n   - Example: For Day 1 Tram 28 — emphasize long queues and high pickpocket risk more prominently (you note both elsewhere, but it helps to add next to the Tram 28 item itself).\\n   - Example: For airport metro route, specify if luggage requires transfers (red line to Alameda + green to Baixa-Chiado etc.) or a simple transfer pattern so users can plan easier.\\n\\nDecision\\n\\nAll primary and acceptance criteria from the Planner are fully met. The items above are enhancements rather than required corrections.\\n\\nAPPROVED\\n\\nIf you want, I can produce a tightened version incorporating the improvements above (Viva Viagem recommendation, sample costs, mobility notes, and explicit Day 5 Option B timings) and output it as a one-page printable timeline.\", type='TextMessage')], stop_reason=\"Text 'APPROVED' mentioned\")"

    "### What worked well?\n",
    "The agent system was quite good at providing detailed, coherent responses. The responses were generally in depth and thorough, covering required aspects and sometimes going above and beyond. The three pronged approach to answering a query/accomplishing a task worked well because it didn't overwhelm any singular agent, but instead allowed for each agent to execute its relative task to the fullest and produce a proper response. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What struggled?\n",
    "The system struggled with following specific guidelines at times. For instance, it did not meet the 150 word requirement for the second task. Also, sometimes it did more than asked and went overboard with its responses, which could be both a good and bad thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential improvements:\n",
    "One improvement could be providing some more distinction between the tasks/outcomes of the planning agent and the implementer agent. Sometimes the implementer agent would simply take the outputs of the planning agent and restructure the response, and would not add its own additions. Ensuring the planning agent only does planning might lead to a more efficient system.\n",
