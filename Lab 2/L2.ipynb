    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab focuses on:\n",
    "- Breaking down complex problems into smaller tasks (task decomposition)\n",
    "- Defining specialized agents with clear roles and responsibilities  \n",
    "- Choosing appropriate multi-agent design patterns\n",
    "- Specifying communication protocols between agents\n",
    "- Implementing a three-agent system using AutoGen\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: If you already know what you're going to do for your final project, you may use this lab to make progress on it. Otherwise, treat this lab as a distinct exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decompose a complex problem into a comprehensive set of constituent tasks\n",
    "- Identify and define the roles, responsibilities, and abilities of individual agents\n",
    "- Select and justify an appropriate multi-agent design pattern (Manager‑Worker, Sequential Pipeline, Collaborative Team)\n",
    "- Explain and apply foundational agent communication protocols at a high level (MCP, A2A)\n",
    "- Start thinking about the architecture of your project (agents, tasks, design pattern, and interaction protocols)"

      "  - Bairro Alto = nightlife\n",
      "- Tickets to pre-book (dates & times required):\n",
      "  - Jerónimos Monastery (Belém)\n",

      "  - São Jorge Castle (optional timed slots)\n",
      "- Train & local transport:\n",
      "  - Sintra train: buy at Rossio station/online via CP; arrive early (first trains fill in high season).\n",
      "  - Cascais train: buy at Cais do Sodré station; scenic coastal line.\n",
      "  - Tram 28: no reservations; plan for off-peak boarding or board short loops.\n",
      "- Night 4 dining reservation:\n",
      "  - If Fado: call/email Clube de Fado, Casa de Linhares, or similar — request a table with Fado (some venues have set menus).\n",

      "  - Mid-range hotel (central): €100–€200/night\n",
      "  - Meals: casual €12–20; mid-range €25–50; Michelin tasting €120–250+\n",
      "  - Attraction entries: €6–20; Pena Palace ~€14–€20; Quinta da Regaleira ~€8–€10\n",
      "  - Trains (Lisbon–Sintra/Cascais): €2–5 each way regional.\n",
      "- Payment & connectivity:\n",

      "  - Pick up a local eSIM / SIM or rely on roaming and free Wi‑Fi in cafes.\n",

      "Contingency & alternatives\n",
      "- Rainy day: swap outdoor Sintra walking for National Palace of Sintra interiors earlier, or more museum time (MAAT, Coach Museum).\n",
      "- Mobility issues: use taxis/tuk‑tuks in Sintra and Cascais; book transfers rather than trains where helpful.\n",
      "- If you prefer fewer day trips: replace Sintra or Cascais with longer time in Lisbon museums & neighborhoods (Calouste Gulbenkian Museum, National Tile Museum).\n",

      "4. Any dietary restrictions or mobility constraints?\n",
      "5. Do you want me to:\n",
      "   - Reserve timed tickets (Pena, Regaleira, Jerónimos, São Jorge)?\n",
      "   - Reserve Night 4 dinner (I’ll need date, party size, name/email/phone)?\n",
      "   - Produce Google Maps links & printable one‑page daily itineraries?\n",
      "\n",
      "Validation summary (requirements check)\n",
      "- Destination is a sovereign country; base is Lisbon — confirmed.\n",
      "- Itinerary length = 5 days — confirmed.\n",

      "\n",
      "IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE\n",
      "---------- TextMessage (Critic) ----------\n",
      "Summary evaluation\n",
      "- The Implementer’s itinerary meets the Planner’s and user’s requirements: 5 days, at least two activities per day, realistic travel times/logistics, a mix of cultural/historical/leisure activities, and a special dining experience on Night 4. Overall quality is high and actionable.\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s done well\n",
      "- Clear day-by-day schedule with realistic transit times and buffers.\n",
      "- Good mix of cultural (Fado, museums), historical (monasteries, castles), and leisure (beaches, LX Factory).\n",
      "- Practical booking guidance (timed tickets, dinner reservations), packing list, contingency suggestions, and approximate budgets.\n",
      "- Reasonable alternatives for high-queue items (e.g., off-peak Tram 28, tuk-tuks/taxis in Sintra).\n",
      "\n",
      "Gaps, errors, and missing elements (with specific fixes)\n",
      "1. Public-transport practicalities and passes\n",
      "   - Gap: No mention of the local rechargeable card (Viva Viagem / Lisboa Viva) used for trams, trains and metro.\n",
      "   - Fix: Add instruction to buy/load a Viva Viagem card at the airport or major stations and rough fares for single vs daily use.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Tram 28 and safety/queue alternatives\n",
      "   - Gap: Tram 28 queues can be very long and pickpocketing is common on crowded trams.\n",
      "   - Fix: Add alternatives: take a short official hop-on hop-off section, use tram 12 or 24 for reduced crowds, or walk key segments. Add safety tip to keep valuables secure and use a front‑zip money pouch.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Airport → city directions clarity\n",
      "   - Minor inaccuracy/unclear phrasing: “Aerobus/Metro Red Line + transfer” could confuse users unfamiliar with Lisbon lines.\n",
      "   - Fix: Clarify: Aerobus (direct to Praça do Comércio/Sete Rios options) ~25–40 min; Metro Red Line from airport to Alameda / transfer to Green Line to Baixa-Chiado typically 25–35 min (plus walking). Offer private transfer as an option for faster door-to-door arrival.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Accessibility specifics\n",
      "   - Gap: While mobility alternatives are briefly mentioned, the plan should more explicitly warn about steep hills, cobblestones and many stairs (Alfama, Sintra, many viewpoints).\n",
      "   - Fix: Add explicit accessibility notes per day (e.g., “Sintra: several steep uphill walks—consider bus 434 or taxi; Alfama: uneven cobbles and steps—not ideal for wheelchairs”).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Timing contingency for arrival/departure\n",
      "   - Gap: The plan assumes midday arrival and evening departure but doesn’t include quick reduced itineraries if arrival or departure times are much earlier/later.\n",
      "   - Fix: Add quick swap suggestions: if arrival is late afternoon, skip Tram 28 and do a short evening walk + nearby dinner; if departure is morning/daytime, recommend LX Factory be skipped and schedule lighter activities close to hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Contact/booking links and concrete reservations\n",
      "   - Gap: The itinerary suggests reservations but does not give direct links or contact approaches (websites/phone numbers) for major items.\n",
      "   - Fix: Include specific booking links or note that the next step (which Implementer already offered) should provide timed-ticket links and restaurant contact info. Recommend exact lead times for Belcanto/Quinta etc. (e.g., Belcanto often needs 4–6 weeks in high season).\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Safety & local customs\n",
      "   - Gap: No brief note on common local customs (tipping, dress for churches/fado houses) or emergency numbers.\n",
      "   - Fix: Add: emergency number 112; tipping: small service charge not always expected but 5–10% is appreciated; modest clothing for church visits; arrive slightly early for Fado dinners.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Minor factual clarifications\n",
      "   - Note: “Type F” plug is correct but Portugal uses Type C and F—mention both to avoid confusion.\n",
      "   - Fix: State “Type C and Type F compatible plugs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Suggested small improvements to enhance usability\n",
      "- Provide a one‑page printable summary per day with addresses, approximate transit steps (e.g., “Hotel → Rossio Station: 12–15 min walk / 10 min taxi”), and suggested booking links.\n",
      "- Add estimated walking distances or steps for each day (easy/moderate/strenuous).\n",
      "- Include approximate total daily budgets (low/medium/high) so travelers can plan cash/cards.\n",
      "- Offer a short “if-rain” swap option for each day (already done generally; make it per day).\n",
      "- Recommend offline map downloads and show how to save attraction bookings as screenshots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final verdict\n",
      "- All core acceptance criteria (5 days, ≥2 activities/day, realistic logistics, mixed activities, Night 4 special dining) are satisfied.\n",
      "- The listed gaps are mostly enhancements and clarifications rather than failures of requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decision\n",
      "- APPROVED\n",
      "\n",
      "You can act on this plan as-is. If you want, I can request the Implementer to incorporate the suggested fixes (Viva Viagem guidance, accessibility notes, quick contingency swaps, booking/contact links, safety tips, and printable one‑page sheets).\n"

Overall quality is high and actionable.\\n\\nWhat’s done well\\n- Clear day-by-day schedule with realistic transit times and buffers.\\n- Good mix of cultural (Fado, museums), historical (monasteries, castles), and leisure (beaches, LX Factory).\\n- Practical booking guidance (timed tickets, dinner reservations), packing list, contingency suggestions, and approximate budgets.\\n- Reasonable alternatives for high-queue items (e.g., off-peak Tram 28, tuk-tuks/taxis in Sintra).\\n\\nGaps, errors, and missing elements (with specific fixes)\\n1. Public-transport practicalities and passes\\n   - Gap: No mention of the local rechargeable card (Viva Viagem / Lisboa Viva) used for trams, trains and metro.\\n   - Fix: Add instruction to buy/load a Viva Viagem card at the airport or major stations and rough fares for single vs daily use.\\n\\n2. Tram 28 and safety/queue alternatives\\n   - Gap: Tram 28 queues can be very long and pickpocketing is common on crowded trams.\\n   - Fix: Add alternatives: take a short official hop-on hop-off section, use tram 12 or 24 for reduced crowds, or walk key segments. Add safety tip to keep valuables secure and use a front‑zip money pouch.\\n\\n3. Airport → city directions clarity\\n   - Minor inaccuracy/unclear phrasing: “Aerobus/Metro Red Line + transfer” could confuse users unfamiliar with Lisbon lines.\\n   - Fix: Clarify: Aerobus (direct to Praça do Comércio/Sete Rios options) ~25–40 min; Metro Red Line from airport to Alameda / transfer to Green Line to Baixa-Chiado typically 25–35 min (plus walking). Offer private transfer as an option for faster door-to-door arrival.\\n\\n4. Accessibility specifics\\n   - Gap: While mobility alternatives are briefly mentioned, the plan should more explicitly warn about steep hills, cobblestones and many stairs (Alfama, Sintra, many viewpoints).\\n   - Fix: Add explicit accessibility notes per day (e.g., “Sintra: several steep uphill walks—consider bus 434 or taxi; Alfama: uneven cobbles and steps—not ideal for wheelchairs”).\\n\\n5. Timing contingency for arrival/departure\\n   - Gap: The plan assumes midday arrival and evening departure but doesn’t include quick reduced itineraries if arrival or departure times are much earlier/later.\\n   - Fix: Add quick swap suggestions: if arrival is late afternoon, skip Tram 28 and do a short evening walk + nearby dinner; if departure is morning/daytime, recommend LX Factory be skipped and schedule lighter activities close to hotel.\\n\\n6. Contact/booking links and concrete reservations\\n   - Gap: The itinerary suggests reservations but does not give direct links or contact approaches (websites/phone numbers) for major items.\\n   - Fix: Include specific booking links or note that the next step (which Implementer already offered) should provide timed-ticket links and restaurant contact info. Recommend exact lead times for Belcanto/Quinta etc. (e.g., Belcanto often needs 4–6 weeks in high season).\\n\\n7. Safety & local customs\\n   - Gap: No brief note on common local customs (tipping, dress for churches/fado houses) or emergency numbers.\\n   - Fix: Add: emergency number 112; tipping: small service charge not always expected but 5–10% is appreciated; modest clothing for church visits; arrive slightly early for Fado dinners.\\n\\n8. Minor factual clarifications\\n   - Note: “Type F” plug is correct but Portugal uses Type C and F—mention both to avoid confusion.\\n   - Fix: State “Type C and Type F compatible plugs.”\\n\\nSuggested small improvements to enhance usability\\n- Provide a one‑page printable summary per day with addresses, approximate transit steps (e.g., “Hotel → Rossio Station: 12–15 min walk / 10 min taxi”), and suggested booking links.\\n- Add estimated walking distances or steps for each day (easy/moderate/strenuous).\\n- Include approximate total daily budgets (low/medium/high) so travelers can plan cash/cards.\\n- Offer a short “if-rain” swap option for each day (already done generally; make it per day).\\n- Recommend offline map downloads and show how to save attraction bookings as screenshots.\\n\\nFinal verdict\\n- All core acceptance criteria (5 days, ≥2 activities/day, realistic logistics, mixed activities, Night 4 special dining) are satisfied.\\n- The listed gaps are mostly enhancements and clarifications rather than failures of requirements.\\n\\nDecision\\n- APPROVED\\n\\nYou can act on this plan as-is. If you want, I can request the Implementer to incorporate the suggested fixes (Viva Viagem guidance, accessibility notes, quick contingency swaps, booking/contact links, safety tips, and printable one‑page sheets).', type='TextMessage')], stop_reason=\"Text 'APPROVED' mentioned\")"

    "### What worked well?\n",
    "The agent system was quite good at providing detailed, coherent responses. The responses were generally in depth and thorough, covering required aspects and sometimes going above and beyond. The three pronged approach to answering a query/accomplishing a task worked well because it didn't overwhelm any singular agent, but instead allowed for each agent to execute its relative task to the fullest and produce a proper response. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What struggled?\n",
    "The system struggled with following specific guidelines at times. For instance, it did not meet the 150 word requirement for the second task. Also, sometimes it did more than asked and went overboard with its responses, which could be both a good and bad thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential improvements:\n",
    "One improvement could be providing some more distinction between the tasks/outcomes of the planning agent and the implementer agent. Sometimes the implementer agent would simply take the outputs of the planning agent and restructure the response, and would not add its own additions. Ensuring the planning agent only does planning might lead to a more efficient system.\n",
