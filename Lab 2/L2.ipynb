    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab focuses on:\n",
    "- Breaking down complex problems into smaller tasks (task decomposition)\n",
    "- Defining specialized agents with clear roles and responsibilities  \n",
    "- Choosing appropriate multi-agent design patterns\n",
    "- Specifying communication protocols between agents\n",
    "- Implementing a three-agent system using AutoGen\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: If you already know what you're going to do for your final project, you may use this lab to make progress on it. Otherwise, treat this lab as a distinct exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decompose a complex problem into a comprehensive set of constituent tasks\n",
    "- Identify and define the roles, responsibilities, and abilities of individual agents\n",
    "- Select and justify an appropriate multi-agent design pattern (Manager‑Worker, Sequential Pipeline, Collaborative Team)\n",
    "- Explain and apply foundational agent communication protocols at a high level (MCP, A2A)\n",
    "- Start thinking about the architecture of your project (agents, tasks, design pattern, and interaction protocols)"

performance depends on pivot strategy; some variants (3-way partitioning) handle many equal keys efficiently.\\n- Merge Sort: not adaptive in classical version; some optimized merges can detect runs (basis for Timsort).\\n4.4 Parallelism:\\n- Both are amenable to parallelization—Merge Sort’s merges and Quick Sort’s independent partitions can be sorted in parallel with care.\\n\\n5) Step 5 — Pros and cons (concise comparison)\\n- Input: collated characteristics from prior steps.\\n- Output: bullet lists of pros and cons for each algorithm.\\n- Acceptance criteria (testable):\\n  - Each algorithm has at least 4 pros and 4 cons listed, tied to concrete properties (time/space/stability/practical issues).\\n\\nDeliverable:\\n5.1 Quick Sort — Pros:\\n- Excellent average-case performance: O(n log n) with a small constant factor.\\n- In-place: low extra memory use (no O(n) auxiliary array in common implementations).\\n- Cache-friendly for arrays;

Use randomized pivot selection or introsort (switch to heap sort when recursion depth is too large) to avoid pathological worst-case O(n^2).\\n- If you require stability, guaranteed worst-case O(n log n), or are sorting linked lists or doing external/disk-based merges, prefer Merge Sort: it is stable, predictable, and well-suited to external merging and linked-list sorting, despite needing extra memory for array-based merges.\\n- For library implementers: often the best practical approach is a hybrid—introsort (Quick Sort + Heap Sort fallback) or mergesort-based hybrids like Timsort (which exploit runs)—to get both practical speed and worst-case guarantees or adaptivity.\\n\\nConcise summary table (text form):\\n- Quick Sort: Avg O(n log n), Best O(n log n), Worst O(n^2); Space O(log n) avg stack; in-place; not stable; best for in-memory sorts with low extra memory.\\n- Merge Sort: Avg/Best/Worst O(n log n); Space O(n) extra (array) or O(1) for lists; stable; predictable; best for stable sorts, linked lists, and external sorting.\\n\\nEnd state: you should be able to choose based on:\\n- Need for stability or worst-case guarantees → Merge Sort.\\n- Need for lower memory usage and fastest average-case in-memory sorting → Quick Sort (with mitigations for worst-case).\\n\\nIf you’d like, I can:\\n- Provide code examples (in-place Quick Sort and array-based Merge Sort).\\n- Provide complexity derivations or visual diagrams.\\n- Suggest parameterized rules for pivot selection and when to switch to insertion sort for small partitions.\\n\\nPLAN_COMPLETE', type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(id='eb4adb10-c7f9-4408-a13d-2fe161064d47', source='Implementer', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=2090, completion_tokens=2112), metadata={}, created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 10, 1, 4, 22, 14, 245926, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), content='Step 1 — Definitions and key characteristics\\n- Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that partitions an array around a pivot and recursively sorts the partitions.

Standard array-based Merge Sort is stable and requires O(n) auxiliary space; Merge Sort on linked lists can be done in-place (O(1) extra pointer space) and remains stable.\\n\\nStep 2 — Time complexity (best / average / worst) with rationale\\n- Quick Sort\\n  - Best: O(n log n) — when partitions are well balanced (pivot near median), recursion depth ~log n, O(n) work per level.\\n  - Average: O(n log n) — random or typical inputs produce reasonably balanced partitions on average.\\n  - Worst: O(n^2) — occurs when partitions are highly unbalanced every level (e.g., picking first/last element as pivot on already sorted input).\\n- Merge Sort\\n  - Best: O(n log n) — splitting and merging cost remains O(n log n); classical Merge Sort does not get asymptotically better on presorted data.\\n  - Average: O(n log n).\\n  - Worst: O(n log n) — consistent recursion depth and merge work regardless of input order.\\n\\nStep 3 — Space complexity (typical implementations and variants)\\n- Quick Sort (array, in-place partitioning)\\n  - Auxiliary array: none (in-place).\\n  - Stack / recursion: O(log n) expected (balanced partitions, tail-call optimizations), O(n) worst-case stack depth if partitions are extremely unbalanced.\\n  - Stable? Not in typical in-place versions without extra memory.\\n- Merge Sort (array-based)\\n  - Auxiliary array: O(n) extra space for merging (unless implemented with explicit out-of-place buffers or in-place merging algorithms which are complex and slower).\\n  - Stack / recursion: O(log n).\\n  - Linked-list variant: O(1) extra pointer space and stable; merges can be done by pointer manipulation without O(n) auxiliary arrays.\\n- Notes:\\n  - Introsort (hybrid Quick Sort + Heap Sort) uses similar space to Quick Sort for recursion and avoids O(n^2) time by switching to Heap Sort if recursion gets too deep.\\n  - Timsort (used in many standard libraries) is a sophisticated mergesort-based hybrid that exploits natural runs and uses O(n) worst-case extra space but often less.\\n\\nStep 4 — Stability and other practical properties\\n- Stability\\n  - Quick Sort: typically unstable. Stable Quick Sorts exist but require extra memory or bookkeeping.\\n  - Merge Sort: stable in its standard merge implementation (ties preserve original order).\\n- Cache behavior / locality\\n  - Quick Sort: generally cache-friendly for arrays because partitioning operates locally; good locality on subarrays leads to fast practical performance.\\n  - Merge Sort: less cache-friendly in array-based form because merging can move data between arrays; access patterns are sequential and predictable which is still reasonable for caches but often has higher constant factors.\\n- Adaptivity to partially-sorted data\\n  - Quick Sort: not particularly adaptive by default; pivot strategy matters. Variants (3-way partitioning) handle many equal keys better.\\n  - Merge Sort: not adaptive in the classical form; Timsort (a mergesort-based hybrid) is adaptive and exploits runs to be faster on partially-sorted data.\\n- Parallelism\\n  - Both parallelize well: Quick Sort can sort partitions in parallel; Merge Sort parallelizes merges and sub-sorts. Merge Sort’s predictable divide-and-conquer merging often maps cleanly to parallel frameworks.\\n\\nStep 5 — Pros and cons (concise comparison)\\n- Quick Sort — Pros\\n  1. Excellent average-case performance: O(n log n) with small constant factors.\\n  2. In-place: uses little extra memory (no O(n) buffer in standard implementations).\\n  3. Very cache-friendly for arrays due to localized partitioning.\\n  4. Simple and fast in practice; easy to hybridize (introsort) to avoid worst-case.\\n  5. With randomization or median-of-three pivoting, worst-case likelihood is tiny.\\n- Quick Sort — Cons\\n  1. Worst-case time O(n^2) if pivot selection is poor (mitigable but must be handled).\\n  2. Typically unstable; preserving relative order of equal keys requires extra work.\\n  3. Recursion depth can become O(n) in pathological cases (stack overflow risk).\\n  4. Performance sensitive to pivot choice and to many equal keys (requires 3-way partitioning for efficiency).\\n- Merge Sort — Pros\\n  1. Guaranteed O(n log n) worst-case time complexity.\\n  2. Stable by default — preserves order of equal keys (important for multi-key sorts).\\n  3. Well-suited for linked lists (O(1) extra space) and external sorting (sequential I/O-friendly).\\n  4. Predictable performance and easy to parallelize for large datasets.\\n- Merge Sort — Cons\\n  1. Requires O(n) extra space for array-based implementations (memory overhead).\\n  2. Generally less cache-friendly / higher constant factors in memory-resident sorts than Quick Sort.\\n  3. More copying during merge steps increases memory bandwidth usage.\\n  4. Slightly more complex to implement in-place and still efficient; in-place merges are slower.\\n\\nStep 6 — Practical use cases and guidelines\\n- Prefer Quick Sort when:\\n  1. Sorting arrays in-memory where low auxiliary memory and fast average-case performance matter (general-purpose in-memory sorts).\\n  2. Memory is constrained and allocating O(n) extra space is expensive.\\n  3. You can use a robust hybrid (introsort) or randomized pivot selection to avoid worst-case behavior.\\n  4. Cache locality and throughput are important (e.g., performance-critical inner loops).\\n- Prefer Merge Sort when:\\n  1. Stability is required (e.g., sorting by secondary key without losing primary-key order).\\n  2. Worst-case time guarantees are important (real-time or predictable-performance systems).\\n  3. Sorting linked lists (Merge Sort can be O(1) extra space and very natural for lists).\\n  4. External sorting / large datasets on disk — merging maps well to sequential I/O and k-way merge techniques.\\n- Hybrid and library practices\\n  - Many standard libraries use hybrids: introsort (Quick Sort with Heap Sort fallback) for arrays, and Timsort (run-detecting, merge-based) where adaptivity and stability are desired.\\n\\nStep 7 — Final recommendation with justification\\n- Default recommendation for general-purpose in-memory array sorting:\\n  - Use Quick Sort (or better, an introsort hybrid) as the default for in-memory arrays: it gives the best practical throughput due to small constants and good cache behavior, and uses little extra memory. Mitigate its worst-case by using randomized pivot selection, median-of-three, three-way partitioning for many equal keys, or use introsort to switch to Heap Sort if recursion depth is too deep.\\n- When to prefer Merge Sort:\\n  - Use Merge Sort when stability is required, when you need guaranteed O(n log n) worst-case, when sorting linked lists, or when handling external/large-disk-based merges.

      "IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE\n",
      "---------- TextMessage (Critic) ----------\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "You implemented the Planner’s Lisbon + Sintra/Cascais 5-day itinerary thoroughly and practically. The plan is realistic, includes at least two activities per day, mixes cultural/historical/leisure items, and explicitly includes a special dining experience on Night 4. Each step has concrete tasks, outputs/artifacts to collect, realistic timing/logistics, and testable acceptance criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "What you did well\n",
      "- Followed the Planner’s numbered-steps structure (Day 0 through Day 5).\n",
      "- Gave concrete, actionable tasks for each step and realistic travel times/buffers.\n",
      "- Included a clear mix of cultural, historical, and leisure activities across days.\n",
      "- Provided testable acceptance criteria for each step (tickets/photos/timestamps).\n",
      "- Covered special-dining requirements for Day 4 with appropriate reservation guidance.\n",
      "- Included practical extras (Viva Viagem, apps, packing list) and cost ballpark figures.\n",
      "- Offered clarifying questions to tailor the plan (dates, party size, dietary needs).\n",
      "\n",
      "Gaps, errors, and missing elements (specific)\n",
      "1. Inputs per step are not explicitly listed\n",
      "   - The Planner required \"specific inputs/outputs\" for each numbered step. You provide outputs/artifacts and in Step 0 a list of pre-trip inputs, but you do not consistently state Inputs for Day 1–Day 5 (e.g., what the traveler needs to bring/have ready that morning: tickets, exact meeting points, hotel contact number, transit cards). This is a testable Planner requirement that’s not fully satisfied in step-level format.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Rain/contingency and mobility-friendly variants are limited\n",
      "   - While you mention optional taxis/tuk-tuks and suggest early starts to avoid crowds, there are no explicit alternate plans for bad weather (e.g., substitute indoor activities) or full accessibility/mobility-friendly routes for each day. The Planner indicated variants could be requested; it would be stronger to include baseline alternatives for these common contingencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Per-day cost estimates and time budgets could be tighter\n",
      "   - You provide useful overall cost ballparks but not per-day breakout estimates. Likewise, while you give realistic durations, a simple per-day timeline with start/end times for each activity (sample morning/afternoon/evening windows) for each day would make acceptance testing easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Local contact & communications details omitted\n",
      "   - The plan includes emergency number 112 and apps, but lacks guidance on local SIM/eSIM options, embassy contact, and hotel phone numbers/addresses as inputs to be collected per step (useful for acceptance testing and contingencies).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Minor clarity: Step names vs outputs labeling\n",
      "   - You swapped some labels (e.g., “Concrete outputs/artifacts” vs Planner’s “Outputs” and “Actionable tasks” vs “Activities”) which is fine but made Inputs omission less obvious. For strict matching against Planner criteria, add an explicit “Inputs” subsection under each step.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suggested concrete improvements (actionable)\n",
      "1. Add an explicit \"Inputs\" subsection to Steps 1–5\n",
      "   - Example for Day 1 Inputs: hotel address & phone, check-in time, Viva Viagem card or cash, Castelo ticket (if purchased), phone with maps and charger, weather check.\n",
      "   - Make these short lists per day so acceptance testers can confirm pre-conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Add per-day sample timeline with start/end times and time budgets\n",
      "   - For each day include a short sample schedule (e.g., 09:00 depart hotel → 10:00–12:00 Pena Palace → 12:30 lunch → 13:45 Moorish Castle → 16:00 Quinta da Regaleira → 17:30 train back) so reviewers can validate feasibility against real train schedules.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Provide alternative indoor/accessible options\n",
      "   - For rain: suggest alternatives (e.g., National Tile Museum or a tram museum in place of outdoor viewpoints).\n",
      "   - For limited mobility: indicate where taxis or shorter walking routes replace stairs/hills (e.g., skip Moorish Castle walk in favor of viewpoints reachable by taxi).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Per-day cost estimate and transport time table\n",
      "   - Add a small cost estimate per day (transport + entry fees + meals) and a short transport time table (typical transfer times between key nodes) to help acceptance testers evaluate budget/logistics.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Add recommended pre-travel communications\n",
      "   - Recommend saving hotel phone/address, embassy number, eSIM/SIM options, and restaurant contact in the travel folder for each day’s Inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. (Optional) Provide one sample date-specific mini-schedule\n",
      "   - Once a date or month is given, add one sample day with exact train times and a locked dinner reservation window to demonstrate end-to-end testability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decision\n",
      "Not approved. The implementation is high quality and largely meets the Planner’s intent, but it does not fully satisfy the Planner’s explicit requirement to list \"specific inputs/outputs\" for each step (Inputs missing for Days 1–5) and would benefit from the contingency/mobility alternatives and per-day timelines/costs requested above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next steps to reach approval\n",
      "- Add explicit Inputs subsections to Steps 1–5.\n",
      "- Add a concise per-day sample timeline (start/end times).\n",
      "- Add at least one indoor/rain or mobility-friendly alternative per affected day.\n",
      "- Add per-day cost estimates and short transport time table.\n",
      "- Optionally, include local sim/embassy/hotel phone as part of Inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once those items are added, I will re-review and — if everything else remains as thorough and testable as it currently is — mark the implementation as APPROVED.\n"

Budget preference for restaurants (e.g., Michelin splurge vs. upscale local cuisine vs. mid-range)?\\n4. Any mobility constraints (affects walking times and whether taxis/tuk-tuks should be prioritized)?\\n\\nIf you confirm dates and number of people I can produce: (a) a sample timed schedule with exact train times and restaurant reservation windows for a chosen date, (b) a printable packing and confirmation checklist tailored to your party.\\n\\nIMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE', type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(id='c1be270c-135b-4c87-a5ad-8a4722f824da', source='Critic', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=4935, completion_tokens=2252), metadata={}, created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 10, 1, 4, 25, 12, 908865, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), content='Summary\\nYou implemented the Planner’s Lisbon + Sintra/Cascais 5-day itinerary thoroughly and practically. The plan is realistic, includes at least two activities per day, mixes cultural/historical/leisure items, and explicitly includes a special dining experience on Night 4. Each step has concrete tasks, outputs/artifacts to collect, realistic timing/logistics, and testable acceptance criteria.\\n\\nWhat you did well\\n- Followed the Planner’s numbered-steps structure (Day 0 through Day 5).\\n- Gave concrete, actionable tasks for each step and realistic travel times/buffers.\\n- Included a clear mix of cultural, historical, and leisure activities across days.\\n- Provided testable acceptance criteria for each step (tickets/photos/timestamps).\\n- Covered special-dining requirements for Day 4 with appropriate reservation guidance.\\n- Included practical extras (Viva Viagem, apps, packing list) and cost ballpark figures.\\n- Offered clarifying questions to tailor the plan (dates, party size, dietary needs).\\n\\nGaps, errors, and missing elements (specific)\\n1. Inputs per step are not explicitly listed\\n   - The Planner required \"specific inputs/outputs\" for each numbered step. You provide outputs/artifacts and in Step 0 a list of pre-trip inputs, but you do not consistently state Inputs for Day 1–Day 5 (e.g., what the traveler needs to bring/have ready that morning: tickets, exact meeting points, hotel contact number, transit cards). This is a testable Planner requirement that’s not fully satisfied in step-level format.\\n\\n2. Rain/contingency and mobility-friendly variants are limited\\n   - While you mention optional taxis/tuk-tuks and suggest early starts to avoid crowds, there are no explicit alternate plans for bad weather (e.g., substitute indoor activities) or full accessibility/mobility-friendly routes for each day. The Planner indicated variants could be requested; it would be stronger to include baseline alternatives for these common contingencies.\\n\\n3. Per-day cost estimates and time budgets could be tighter\\n   - You provide useful overall cost ballparks but not per-day breakout estimates. Likewise, while you give realistic durations, a simple per-day timeline with start/end times for each activity (sample morning/afternoon/evening windows) for each day would make acceptance testing easier.\\n\\n4. Local contact & communications details omitted\\n   - The plan includes emergency number 112 and apps, but lacks guidance on local SIM/eSIM options, embassy contact, and hotel phone numbers/addresses as inputs to be collected per step (useful for acceptance testing and contingencies).\\n\\n5. Minor clarity: Step names vs outputs labeling\\n   - You swapped some labels (e.g., “Concrete outputs/artifacts” vs Planner’s “Outputs” and “Actionable tasks” vs “Activities”) which is fine but made Inputs omission less obvious. For strict matching against Planner criteria, add an explicit “Inputs” subsection under each step.\\n\\nSuggested concrete improvements (actionable)\\n1. Add an explicit \"Inputs\" subsection to Steps 1–5\\n   - Example for Day 1 Inputs: hotel address & phone, check-in time, Viva Viagem card or cash, Castelo ticket (if purchased), phone with maps and charger, weather check.\\n   - Make these short lists per day so acceptance testers can confirm pre-conditions.\\n\\n2. Add per-day sample timeline with start/end times and time budgets\\n   - For each day include a short sample schedule (e.g., 09:00 depart hotel → 10:00–12:00 Pena Palace → 12:30 lunch → 13:45 Moorish Castle → 16:00 Quinta da Regaleira → 17:30 train back) so reviewers can validate feasibility against real train schedules.\\n\\n3. Provide alternative indoor/accessible options\\n   - For rain: suggest alternatives (e.g., National Tile Museum or a tram museum in place of outdoor viewpoints).\\n   - For limited mobility: indicate where taxis or shorter walking routes replace stairs/hills (e.g., skip Moorish Castle walk in favor of viewpoints reachable by taxi).\\n\\n4. Per-day cost estimate and transport time table\\n   - Add a small cost estimate per day (transport + entry fees + meals) and a short transport time table (typical transfer times between key nodes) to help acceptance testers evaluate budget/logistics.\\n\\n5. Add recommended pre-travel communications\\n   - Recommend saving hotel phone/address, embassy number, eSIM/SIM options, and restaurant contact in the travel folder for each day’s Inputs.\\n\\n6. (Optional) Provide one sample date-specific mini-schedule\\n   - Once a date or month is given, add one sample day with exact train times and a locked dinner reservation window to demonstrate end-to-end testability.\\n\\nDecision\\nNot approved. The implementation is high quality and largely meets the Planner’s intent, but it does not fully satisfy the Planner’s explicit requirement to list \"specific inputs/outputs\" for each step (Inputs missing for Days 1–5) and would benefit from the contingency/mobility alternatives and per-day timelines/costs requested above.\\n\\nNext steps to reach approval\\n- Add explicit Inputs subsections to Steps 1–5.\\n- Add a concise per-day sample timeline (start/end times).\\n- Add at least one indoor/rain or mobility-friendly alternative per affected day.\\n- Add per-day cost estimates and short transport time table.\\n- Optionally, include local sim/embassy/hotel phone as part of Inputs.\\n\\nOnce those items are added, I will re-review and — if everything else remains as thorough and testable as it currently is — mark the implementation as APPROVED.', type='TextMessage')], stop_reason=\"Text 'APPROVED' mentioned\")"

    "### What worked well?\n",
    "The agent system was quite good at providing detailed, coherent responses. The responses were generally in depth and thorough, covering required aspects and sometimes going above and beyond. The three pronged approach to answering a query/accomplishing a task worked well because it didn't overwhelm any singular agent, but instead allowed for each agent to execute its relative task to the fullest and produce a proper response. \n",

    "### What struggled?\n",

    "One improvement could be providing some more distinction between the tasks/outcomes of the planning agent and the implementer agent.

    "\n",
    "- **Task Decomposition**: We learned that breaking down complex problems seems difficult at first, but when you clearly lay out the scope and take a look at the big picture, you are able to section out and identify independent tasks. You can then delegate these to, in our case, various agents that can come together to solve the problem.\n",
    "- **Agent Design**: We learned that when it comes to defining agent roles and responsibilities, it is important too never delegate too much or even too little to one agent. If you make an agent's task too complex, it may not be able to perform it effetively and that might indicate adding another agent. But if you provide the agent with a simple ask, it begs the question of whether an agent is needed in the first place. Ultimately, when building agents, the goal/output of the agent must be reasonable and clearly defined.\n",
    "- **Communication Protocols**: MCP is a standardized protocol used by agents to gain access to a series of tools, resources, and prompts. It facilitates agent->tool interactions. A2A on the other hand is a standardized agent->agent communication protocol. Agents built on different frameworks can communicate with easy. Our agent system in part 1 primarily utilized A2A interactions, as we did not have external tools, otherwise we would have incorporated MCP interactions as well.\n",
