    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab focuses on:\n",
    "- Breaking down complex problems into smaller tasks (task decomposition)\n",
    "- Defining specialized agents with clear roles and responsibilities  \n",
    "- Choosing appropriate multi-agent design patterns\n",
    "- Specifying communication protocols between agents\n",
    "- Implementing a three-agent system using AutoGen\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: If you already know what you're going to do for your final project, you may use this lab to make progress on it. Otherwise, treat this lab as a distinct exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decompose a complex problem into a comprehensive set of constituent tasks\n",
    "- Identify and define the roles, responsibilities, and abilities of individual agents\n",
    "- Select and justify an appropriate multi-agent design pattern (Manager‑Worker, Sequential Pipeline, Collaborative Team)\n",
    "- Explain and apply foundational agent communication protocols at a high level (MCP, A2A)\n",
    "- Start thinking about the architecture of your project (agents, tasks, design pattern, and interaction protocols)"

      "  - Prefer QuickSort (or its robust variant, introsort) for raw in-memory array sorting because of its excellent average-case performance, cache efficiency, and low extra memory usage. In production code, use a well-tested library implementation (std::sort uses introsort) which gives QuickSort-like speed with worst-case safeguards.\n",
      "- When to choose MergeSort instead:\n",
      "  - Choose MergeSort when stability is required, when sorting linked lists, when working with data that doesn't fit in memory (external/parallel merges), or when predictable worst-case time guarantees are necessary and you cannot/ do not want to use introsort.\n",
      "- Justification summary:\n",
      "  - QuickSort: better practical throughput for arrays due to cache locality and small constants; in-place reduces memory footprint; randomized or introsort variants mitigate worst-case.\n",
      "  - MergeSort: stronger theoretical guarantees and stability; superior for external and parallel sorting and linked lists; predictable performance and simpler parallelization.\n",
      "- Practical final note:\n",

Recursion depth can be O(n) in degenerate cases; may need tail recursion elimination or explicit stack.\\n  4. Pivot selection overhead or pathological input can degrade performance.\\n  5.

Rationale: QuickSort (and introsort) provide superior practical throughput on arrays because of cache locality, low overhead, and in-place operation; introsort adds a worst-case guarantee without sacrificing typical performance. In real projects, rely on well-tested std library implementations (e.g., C++ std::sort) or TimSort (Python/Java) rather than hand-rolling your own.\\n- When to pick MergeSort instead:\\n  - Choose MergeSort when you need stability, are sorting linked lists, are implementing external or parallel sorts, or require guaranteed O(n log n) worst-case behavior and either cannot use introsort or want a stable guarantee. MergeSort is also appropriate when memory bandwidth and sequential I/O are more important than in-memory cache locality.\\n- Concrete fallback strategies:\\n  - If you need both speed and worst-case guarantees: use introsort (QuickSort + HeapSort fallback).\\n  - If you need stability on arrays and good real-world performance: use TimSort or a stable MergeSort implemented carefully (accepting O(n) extra memory or using run-aware techniques).\\n  - For external sorting of huge datasets: use k-way merge algorithms based on MergeSort principles.\\n\\nConcise justification summary\\n- QuickSort (or introsort) for in-memory arrays gives the best real-world performance in most cases due to cache friendliness and low extra memory; use pivot randomization/median-of-three and hybridization to mitigate worst-case risks.\\n- MergeSort for stability, external or parallel workloads, linked lists, or when worst-case predictability is essential.\\n\\nChecklist (this response meets the Planner acceptance criteria)\\n- Scope and assumptions stated (arrays/linked lists, standard flavors, variants noted).\\n- Time and space complexity for both algorithms provided with best/avg/worst and brief explanations.\\n- Pros and cons enumerated covering stability, space, speed, worst-case behavior, and parallelization.\\n- Practical use cases and mitigations/hybrids listed (QuickSort, MergeSort, introsort, TimSort, linked-list Merge).\\n- Final recommendation given with clear conditions for deviating and fallback strategies.\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- Show short pseudo-code snippets for each algorithm (recursive QuickSort and top-down MergeSort).\\n- Provide benchmark guidance (microbenchmarks to compare on your target hardware and data distributions).\\nWhich would you like next?\\n\\nIMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE', type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(id='f4f0622e-b9f2-4010-9155-8c9a7972bc90', source='Critic', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=4217, completion_tokens=1293), metadata={}, created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 9, 30, 22, 27, 8, 399096, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), content=\"Review summary\\n\\nThe Implementer's response meets the Planner's acceptance criteria: scope and assumptions are explicit, time/space complexities (best/avg/worst) are stated with explanations, pros and cons are enumerated and linked to technical reasons, practical use cases and mitigations/hybrids are provided, and a clear final recommendation with conditions and fallbacks is given.\\n\\nWhat was done well\\n- Scope & assumptions: Clearly states array and linked-list contexts and the implementation flavors (top-down/bottom-up merge, in-place QuickSort, randomized/median-of-three, introsort, TimSort).\\n- Complexity: Gives best/average/worst time complexities and space (auxiliary + recursion) for both algorithms, plus special cases (linked-list merge, in-place merge caveats).\\n- Pros/cons: Detailed, technically justified lists for both algorithms covering stability, memory, cache behavior, worst-case, and parallelization.\\n- Use cases & mitigations: Provides multiple concrete scenarios for choosing each algorithm and lists practical hybrids (randomized QuickSort, introsort, TimSort) and other mitigations.\\n- Recommendation: Concise default recommendation (QuickSort/Introsort for in-memory arrays), and explicit situations where MergeSort is preferable, with fallback strategies.\\n\\nMinor suggestions to improve thoroughness (optional)\\n- Add brief pseudocode snippets (the Implementer offered these); they would help readers who want concrete algorithm outlines.\\n- Note that some adaptive MergeSort implementations (and TimSort) detect runs and can approach O(n) on nearly-sorted data — the Implementer did mention run-detection for TimSort but could explicitly state the potential best-case improvement for such adaptive merges.\\n- Mention that stable QuickSort variants exist (e.g., by pairing keys with indices or using stable partition schemes) but usually incur extra memory or cost — the Implementer touched on instability but could briefly note the trade-offs for making QuickSort stable.\\n- For clarity: indicate that C++ std::stable_sort typically uses a mergesort-like stable algorithm (with O(n) extra memory), while std::sort uses introsort; this helps map recommendations to common library behavior.\\n\\nDecision\\nAll Planner acceptance criteria are fully met and content is accurate and comprehensive.
