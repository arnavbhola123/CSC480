We apply the **agentic design approach** (from Lab 2 and the heuristic integration of Lab 4) to construct a sophisticated state evaluation function that guides the MCTS playouts.\n",

                "Scrabble presents several fundamental challenges that make classical Minimax search impractical. At any given turn, a player typically has hundreds of possible legal moves due to the 7-tile rack and 15×15 board, creating an enormous branching factor that leads to exponential node explosion even with Alpha-Beta pruning. The state space is astronomically large with 100 tiles and countless possible board configurations, far exceeding games like Chess. Most critically, Scrabble involves imperfect information since players cannot see their opponent's tiles, which violates Minimax's assumption of perfect information and forces the algorithm to either make unrealistic assumptions or search over all possible opponent tile combinations. A typical Scrabble game lasts 15 to 25 turns per player, and searching even 3 to 4 moves ahead with a branching factor of 200 would require evaluating millions of positions, making it computationally prohibitive. These factors collectively necessitate alternative approaches like Monte Carlo Tree Search that can handle large state spaces and imperfect information through sampling rather than exhaustive search."

                "The agentic heuristic system demonstrated several notable strengths in its implementation. The agent to agent communication was remarkably clear and structured, with each specialist agent producing detailed natural language analyses that ended with explicit numeric scores in the required format. The Score Estimator analyzed current score differences and upcoming opportunities, the Tile Quality Agent evaluated rack composition and bingo potential, and the Opponent Risk Agent assessed strategic vulnerabilities and defensive priorities. This structured output made information flow transparent and debuggable. The Aggregator agent was highly effective at synthesizing the three specialist scores using the defined weighting formula, consistently producing final scores and showing its reasoning. The modularity of the system was a major success, as each agent operated independently with its own system prompt and evaluation criteria, making the architecture easy to understand and modify. Perhaps most impressively, the quality of strategic reasoning was sophisticated. Agents provided nuanced analyses of board position, rack quality, vowel consonant balance, bingo potential, and defensive considerations that would be difficult to encode in a classical heuristic. The natural language explanations made the evaluation process interpretable and educational, revealing the thought process behind each score in ways that opaque numerical functions cannot.\n",

                "\n",
                "Despite its strengths, the agentic system encountered significant practical challenges. The most critical issue was computational performance. Each heuristic evaluation required four sequential LLM calls, taking approximately 8 to 15 seconds per evaluation. In the MCTS context with 17 legal moves and multiple playouts, this resulted in over 15 minutes for a single game turn, making real time gameplay completely impractical. The system also occasionally struggled with parsing and score extraction. While most agent responses followed the required format, some responses buried scores within lengthy explanations or omitted them entirely, requiring fallback logic and error handling. There was some inconsistency in score magnitudes across evaluations. Different game states with similar characteristics sometimes received notably different scores, suggesting the agents lacked perfect calibration or were influenced by subtle variations in how prompts were phrased. The agents also showed a tendency toward verbose output. Each specialist produced lengthy paragraphs of analysis when only a numeric score was strictly necessary for MCTS, adding to latency without improving decision quality. Finally, there was limited coordination between agents. Each specialist worked independently without seeing other agents' analyses until the Aggregator stage, potentially missing opportunities for agents to challenge or refine each other's assessments through multi turn dialogue.\n",

                "##### Agentic vs. Classical Heuristics\n",
                "\n",
                "The agentic heuristic system demonstrates significantly greater modularity and extensibility compared to a monolithic Python function, though at a substantial computational cost. In the classical approach, all heuristic logic is embedded within a single function where scoring considerations like tile quality, board positioning, and opponent threats are manually weighted and combined by the programmer. This requires deep domain expertise and makes modifications difficult since changing one aspect may have unintended effects on others. In contrast, the agentic system distributes evaluation responsibilities across specialized agents, each focusing on a distinct strategic dimension such as score estimation, tile rack quality, or opponent risk assessment. This separation of concerns allows each agent to develop nuanced reasoning about its specific domain and communicate findings in natural language before the aggregator synthesizes them into a final score. The modularity means new strategic considerations can be added by simply introducing new agents without rewriting existing logic, and individual agents can be refined independently. However, the agentic approach is dramatically slower due to multiple LLM calls per evaluation, making it impractical for real-time game play where thousands of heuristic evaluations are needed. The classical heuristic executes in microseconds while the agentic version may take seconds per evaluation. Ultimately, the agentic system offers superior flexibility and interpretability with explicit reasoning traces, but the classical approach remains necessary for computational efficiency in actual gameplay scenarios like MCTS where speed is critical."
